/**
Payloads are how data should be sent and collected from devices. A simple
normal flow would be for a watch to generate Events and Measurements,
bundle them into a Payload that is sent to mobile. Mobile would then take that
payload, as well as events and measurements generated on the mobile device
itself, and bundle them into it's own Payload message to send to the
Pipeline API

More complex patterns occur when the watch sends mupltiple Payloads, at
different times, to the mobile before it gets a chance to send the data on to
the web, or if multiple devices are connected simultaneously to one mobile
device.
