/**
Measurements represent recordings from sensors at regular intervals, or
algorithm outputs derived from such sensor data.

The structure works a bit like a csv. There is a header which describes the
type and order of the values stored in the data field.

When dealing with measurements it is important to consider if the signal you
are measuring is a sample an integral signal. Samples and integrals are
treated very different mathematically.

Samples only make sense to talk about at instants in time, while integrals
only make sense to talk about  time windows. Heart rate and acceleration are
good examples of sample measurements, while steps and  are good examples of
integral measurements.

For sequential integral measurements, one time window ends an instant before
the next measurement begins, therefore one only need to add an explicit end
to the last measurement (see time_end_utc)

Because of these assumptions, non-sequential integral measurements should
be broken into separate messages.
