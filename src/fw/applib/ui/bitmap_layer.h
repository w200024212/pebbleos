//! \brief Layer that displays a bitmap image.
//!
//! ![](bitmap_layer.png)
//! BitmapLayer is a Layer subtype that draws a GBitmap within its frame. It uses an alignment property
//! to specify how to position the bitmap image within its frame. Optionally, when the
//! background color is not GColorClear, it draws a solid background color behind the
//! bitmap image, filling areas of the frame that are not covered by the bitmap image.
//! Lastly, using the compositing mode property of the BitmapLayer, determines the way the
//! bitmap image is drawn on top of what is underneath it (either the background color, or
//! the layers beneath it).
//!
//! <h3>Inside the Implementation</h3>
//! The implementation of BitmapLayer is fairly straightforward and relies heavily on the
//! functionality as exposed by the core drawing functions (see \ref Drawing).
//! \ref BitmapLayer's drawing callback uses \ref graphics_draw_bitmap_in_rect()
//! to perform the actual drawing of the \ref GBitmap. It uses \ref grect_align() to perform
//! the layout of the image and it uses \ref graphics_fill_rect() to draw the background plane.
//!     @{

//! The data structure of a BitmapLayer, containing a Layer data structure, a pointer to
//! the GBitmap, and all necessary state to draw itself (the background color, alignment and
//! the compositing mode).
//! @note a `BitmapLayer *` can safely be casted to a `Layer *` and can thus be used
//! with all other functions that take a `Layer *` as an argument.
//! <br/>For example, the following is legal:
//! \code{.c}
//! BitmapLayer bitmap_layer;
//! ...
//! layer_set_hidden((Layer *)&bitmap_layer, true);
//! \endcode

//! is filled with the background color.

//! For Aplite, there is no notion of "transparency" in the graphics system. However, the effect of
