//! \brief The basic building block of the user interface
//!
//! Windows are the top-level elements in the UI hierarchy and the basic building blocks for a Pebble
//! UI. A single window is always displayed at a time on Pebble, with the exception of when animating
//! from one window to the other, which, in that case, is managed by the window stack. You can stack
//! windows on top of each other, but only the topmost window will be visible.
//!
//! Users wearing a Pebble typically interact with the content and media displayed in a window, clicking
//! and pressing buttons on the watch, depending on what they see and wish to respond to in a window.
//!
//! Windows serve to display a hierarchy of layers on the screen and handle user input. When a window is
//! visible, its root Layer (and all its child layers) are drawn onto the screen automatically.
//!
//! You need a window, which always fills the entire screen, to display images, text, and graphics in
//! your Pebble app. A layer by itself doesn’t display on Pebble; it must be in the current window’s
//! layer hierarchy to be visible.
//!
//! The Window Stack serves as the global manager of what window is presented and makes sure that input
//! events are forwarded to the topmost window.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude UiFramework.html (chapter "Window") for a conceptual
//! overview of Window, the Window Stack and relevant code examples.

  //! good moment to start timers related to the window, or reset the UI, etc.
  WindowHandler appear;

  //! Called when the window leaves the screen, e.g. when another window
