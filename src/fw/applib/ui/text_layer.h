//! \brief Layer that displays and formats a text string.
//!
//! ![](text_layer.png)
//! The geometric information (bounds, frame) of the Layer
//! is used as the "box" in which the text is drawn. The \ref TextLayer also has a number of
//! other properties that influence how the text is drawn. Most important of these properties are:
//! a pointer to the string to draw itself, the font, the text color, the background color of the
//! layer, the overflow mode and alignment of the text inside the layer.
//! @see Layer
//! @see TextDrawing
//! @see Fonts
//!     @{

//! The data structure of a TextLayer.
//! @note a `TextLayer *` can safely be casted to a `Layer *` and can thus be used
//! with all other functions that take a `Layer *` as an argument.
//! <br/>For example, the following is legal:
//! \code{.c}
//! TextLayer text_layer;
//! ...
//! layer_set_hidden((Layer *)&text_layer, true);
//! \endcode
