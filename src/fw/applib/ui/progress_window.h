//! A UI component that is a window that contains a progress bar. The state of the progress bar
//! is updated using progress_window_set_progress. When the window is first pushed, the progress
//! bar will fill on it's own, faking progress until the max_fake_progress_percent threshold is
//! hit. Once the client wishes to indicate success or failure, calling
//! progress_window_set_progress_success or progress_window_set_progress_failure will cause the
//! UI to animate out to indicate the result, followed by calling the .finished callback if
//! provided. Once progress_window_set_progress_success or progress_window_set_progress_failure
//! has been called, subsequent calls will be ignored.
