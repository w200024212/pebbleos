//! \brief Bi-directional communication between phone apps and Pebble watchapps
//!
//! AppMessage is a bi-directional messaging subsystem that enables communication between phone apps
//! and Pebble watchapps. This is accomplished by allowing phone and watchapps to exchange arbitrary
//! sets of key/value pairs. The key/value pairs are stored in the form of a Dictionary, the layout
//! of which is left for the application developer to define.
//!
//! AppMessage implements a push-oriented messaging protocol, enabling your app to call functions and
//! methods to push messages from Pebble to phone and vice versa. The protocol is symmetric: both Pebble
//! and the phone can send messages. All messages are acknowledged. In this context, there is no
//! client-server model, as such.
//!
//! During the sending phase, one side initiates the communication by transferring a dictionary over the air.
//! The other side then receives this message and is given an opportunity to perform actions on that data.
//! As soon as possible, the other side is expected to reply to the message with a simple acknowledgment
//! that the message was received successfully.
//!
//! PebbleKit JavaScript provides you with a set of standard JavaScript APIs that let your app receive messages
//! from the watch, make HTTP requests, and send new messages to the watch. AppMessage APIs are used to send and
//! receive data. A Pebble watchapp can use the resources of the connected phone to fetch information from web services,
//! send information to web APIs, or store login credentials. On the JavaScript side, you communicate
//! with Pebble via a Pebble object exposed in the namespace.
//!
//! Messages always need to get either ACKnowledged or "NACK'ed," that is, not acknowledged.
//! If not, messages will result in a time-out failure. The AppMessage subsystem takes care of this implicitly.
//! In the phone libraries, this step is a bit more explicit.
//!
//! The Pebble watch interfaces make a distinction between the Inbox and the Outbox calls. The Inbox
//! receives messages from the phone on the watch; the Outbox sends messages from the watch to the phone.
//! These two buffers can be managed separately.
//!
//! <h4>Warning</h4>
//! A critical constraint of AppMessage is that messages are limited in size. An ingoing (outgoing) message
//! larger than the inbox (outbox) will not be transmitted and will generate an error. You can choose your
//! inbox and outbox size when you call app_message_open().
//!
//! Pebble SDK provides a static minimum guaranteed size (APP_MESSAGE_INBOX_SIZE_MINIMUM and APP_MESSAGE_OUTBOX_SIZE_MINIMUM).
//! Requesting a buffer of the minimum guaranteed size (or smaller) is always guaranteed to succeed on all
//! Pebbles in this SDK version or higher, and with every phone.
//!
//! In some context, Pebble might be able to provide your application with larger inbox/outbox.
//! You can call app_message_inbox_size_maximum() and app_message_outbox_size_maximum() in your code to get
//! the largest possible value you can use.
//!
//! To always get the largest buffer available, follow this best practice:
//!
//! app_message_open(app_message_inbox_size_maximum(), app_message_outbox_size_maximum())
//!
//! AppMessage uses your application heap space. That means that the sizes you pick for the AppMessage
//! inbox and outbox buffers are important in optimizing your app’s performance. The more you use for
//! AppMessage, the less space you’ll have for the rest of your app.
//!
//! To register callbacks, you should call app_message_register_inbox_received(), app_message_register_inbox_dropped(),
//! app_message_register_outbox_sent(), app_message_register_outbox_failed().
//!
//! Pebble recommends that you call them before app_message_open() to ensure you do not miss a message
//! arriving between starting AppMessage and registering the callback. You can set a context that will be passed
//! to all the callbacks with app_message_set_context().
//!
//! In circumstances that may not be ideal, when using AppMessage several types of errors may occur.
//! For example:
//!
//! * The send can’t start because the system state won't allow for a success. Several reasons
//!  you're unable to perform a send: A send() is already occurring (only one is possible at a time) or Bluetooth
//!  is not enabled or connected.
//! * The send and receive occur, but the receiver can’t accept the message. For instance, there is no app
//!   that receives such a message.
//! * The send occurs, but the receiver either does not actually receive the message or can’t handle it
//!   in a timely fashion.
//! * In the case of a dropped message, the phone sends a message to the watchapp, while there is still
//!   an unprocessed message in the Inbox.
//!
//! Other errors are possible and described by AppMessageResult. A client of the AppMessage interface
//! should use the result codes to be more robust in the face of communication problems either in the field or while debugging.
//!
//! Refer to the \htmlinclude app-phone-communication.html for a conceptual overview and code usage.
//!
//! For code examples, refer to the SDK Examples that directly use App Message. These include:
//!   * <a href="https://github.com/pebble-examples/pebblekit-js-weather">

//! AppMessage is a messaging subsystem that allows phone and watch applications
//! to exchange arbitrary sets of key-value pairs. The key value pairs are
//! stored in the form of a Dictionary, the layout of which is left for the
//! application developer to define.
//!
//! <h3>Communication Model</h3>
//!
//! AppMessage is a simple send-receive-reply protocol. The protocol is symmetric: both the watch and phone can start
//! sending a message and expect a reply from the other side.
//!
//! In the sending phase, one side initiates the communication by transferring a dictionary over the air. The other
//! side then receives this message and is given an opportunity to perform actions on that data.  As soon as possible,
//! the other side is expected to reply to the message with a simple acknowledgement that the message was received
//! successfully.
//!
//! In non-ideal circumstances, several errors may occur. For example:
//! * The send can't start as the system state won't allow for a success.
//! * The send and receive occur, but the receiver cannot accept the message (for example, there is no app that receives such
//!   a message).
//! * The send occurs, but the receiver either does not actually receive the message or can't handle it in a timely
//!   fashion.
//!
//! Other errors are possible, described by \ref AppMessageResult. A client of the AppMessage interface
//! can use the result codes to be more robust in the face of communication problems either in the field or while
//! debugging.
//!
//! The watch interfaces make a distinction between the Inbox and the Outbox. The Inbox receives messages from the
//! phone on the watch; the Outbox sends messages from the watch to the phone. These two objects can be managed
//! separately.
//!
//! \note Messages are actually addressed by the UUID of the watch and phone apps.  This is done automatically by the
//!       system for the convenience of the client.  However, this does require that both the watch and phone apps
//!       share their UUID.  AppMessage is not capable of 1:N or M:N communication at this time, and is merely 1:1.
