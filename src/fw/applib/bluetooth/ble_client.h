//!  + a service has been removed

//!
//! @note For convenience, the services are owned by the system and references

//! handler, are no longer valid. The application is responsible for cleaning up
//! these references.
//!
//! @param device The device associated with the service discovery process
//! @param update_type Defines what type of service update is being received
//! @param services Array of pointers to the discovered services. The array will
//! only contain Service UUIDs that matches the filter that was passed into the
//! ble_client_discover_services_and_characteristics() call.
//! @param num_services The number of discovered services matching the criteria.

//! If the device was disconnected, BTErrnoConnectionTimeout,
//! BTErrnoRemotelyTerminated, BTErrnoLocallyTerminatedBySystem or
