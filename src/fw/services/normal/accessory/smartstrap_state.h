 * +------------------+------------------+--------------+---------------------------+
 * Notes:
 * - Only KernelBG can send frames when s_is_connected == false
 * - Transitions which can take place from "Any" task are not allowed from ISRs
 * - Received data is ignored in any state except ReadInProgress or NotifyInProgress
 * - Break characters are ignored in any state except ReadReady
 * - We can only start sending data after a successful transition from ReadReady to ReadDisabled
