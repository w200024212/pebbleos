//! A SettingsFile is just a simple binary key-value store. Keys can be strings,
//! uint32_ts, or arbitrary bytes. Values are similarilly flexible. All
//! operations are atomic, so a reboot in the middle of changing the value for a
//! key will always either complete, returning the new value upon reboot, or
//! will just return the old value.
//! It also supports bidirection syncronization between the phone & watch,
//! using timestamps to resolve conflicts.
//! Note that although all operations are atomic, they are not thread-safe. If
//! you will be accessing a SettingsFile from multiple threads, make sure you
//! use locks!

// NOTE: These fields are internal, modify them at your own risk!
