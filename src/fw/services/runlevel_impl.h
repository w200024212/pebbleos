// Definitions used to implement runlevels.
//
// The set of runlevels is defined in the runlevel.def X-Macro file. These
// definitions are used to construct two enums, RunLevel (in runlevel.h) and
// RunLevelBit (in this header).
//
// The set of runlevels for which a service should be enabled is defined by
// bitwise-OR-ing the RunLevelBit constants for every runlevel that the service
// should be enabled in to form an enable-mask. Testing whether a service should
// be enabled for a given runlevel is simply
// (enable_mask & (1 << runlevel) != 0).
//
// The RunLevelBit constants take the form R_<name> to minimize visual clutter
// when defining enable-masks. Since this header is only included in the source
// files for which enable-masks are defined, the potential for namespace
// pollution is minimized.

#define RUNLEVEL(number, name) _Static_assert( \
      0 <= number && number <= 31, \
      "The numeric value of runlevel " #name " (" #number ")" \
      " is out of range. Only runlevels in the range 0 <= level <= 31" \
      " are supported.");
