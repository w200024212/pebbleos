//! CommSession represents a Pebble Protocol communication session. It attempts to abstract away the
//! differences in the underlying data Transport types (iAP over SPP for iOS, plain SPP for Android,
//! PPoGATT for BLE, QEMU ...)
//! There are two types of sessions: the system session and the app session.
//! The system session must be used when communicating to the Pebble app. There can only be one
//! system session at a time. On Android, the system session uses a "hybrid" transport, which means
//! that it also connects to PebbleKit apps (via the Pebble Android app).
//! With iAP/PPoGATT, an app session is a dedicated Pebble Protocol session, connecting directly to
//!  a 3rd party phone app. With PPoGATT, there can be multiple transports and thus multiple app
//! sessions at a time. With iAP transport, it's different. There can only be one iAP-based app
//! session.
