//! @file kernel/services/compositor.h
//! This file manages what's currently shown on the screen of your Pebble!
//! There are two main things that are managed by the compositor...
//!
//! <h3>The App Framebuffer</h3>
//! This is the framebuffer the app is currently drawing into. The compositor
//! handles animating between app framebuffers when the app changes and window
//! animations requested by the window stack. The compositor will also draw in
//! the status bar when the app is in fullscreen, and the app will adjust its
//! framebuffer's destination frame vertically. The framebuffer is simply
//! bitblt'ed into the appropriate position whenever compositor_flush is called.
//!
//! @see \ref compositor_get_child_entity
//! @see \ref compositor_set_entity_framebuffer
//! @see \ref compositor_transition
//! @see \ref window_stack_animation_schedule
//! @see \ref app_emit_render_ready_event
//!
//! <h3>Modal Window</h3>
//! A modal window is a Window that can be rendered on top of an app without
//! interrupting it. The modal window can only be supplied by the kernel, so
//! we can trust its contents. The modal window is animated up and down the
//! screen when its pushed and popped. Since the window doesn't have a framebuffer
//! of its own, we render it to the main framebuffer on top of everything else
//! whenever compositor_flush is called.
//!

//! Transition direction, from the current position to the next.
//! For example, Up is a transition to some item that is upwards of the current screen.

//! stack. For apps the new app we're animating to should always be running. For apps, the

//! Normally you will not call this, as the assigned transition animation automatically runs this.
//! However, if an animation needs to be scheduled inside of the compositor transition animation,
//! the new animation will need to call this in order to properly render.
//! A good use-case for this is when the transition needs to use an animation_sequence.
//!
//! For an example of this being used, check out compositor_shutter_transitions.c
