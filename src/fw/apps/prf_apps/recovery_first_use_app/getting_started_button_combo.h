//! @file prf_button_combo.h
//!
//! This file implements a monitor that watches which buttons are held down. This file looks for
//! 3 combinations.
//!
//! 1) Select held for 5 seconds: Invoke a user provided callback.
//! 2) Down held for 5 seconds: factory reset
//! 3) (PRF ONLY) Up+Down held for 5 seconds: Enter mfg mode
//!
//! The reason it's not just a boring set of long click handlers is because we don't support
//! registering a long click handler for a combination of buttons like up+down.
//!
//! I tried to split this out from a seperate file from the recovery_first_use.c file so I could
//! test this behaviour in a unit test independant in the UI. I think it turned out /okay/. The
//! callback specification is a little odd (only for select but not for the other ones, should we
//! be blowing memory on static behaviour like this?) but it was worth a shot.

typedef struct {
  //! Track which buttons are held. Use this instead of the driver function button_get_state_bits
  //! because that value isn't debounced.
  uint8_t buttons_held_bitset;

  //! Timer for how long the combination has been held for. We use new_timer instead of app_timer
  //! even though it's a little more dangerous (doesn't automatically get cleaned up by the app)
  //! because the api is nicer for starting/stopping/resceduling the same timer over and over
  //! again with different callbacks.

  //! The callback to call when select is held.
