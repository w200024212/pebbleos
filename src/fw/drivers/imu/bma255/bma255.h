//! In order to acheive low power consumptions, the BMA255 Output Data Rate (ODR)
//! is determined by a combination of:
//!    - high-bandwidth operating rate:
//!        Less filtering is done on the bma255, which has a direct impact on power consumption.
//!        This gives a lower "update time", which in turn means less "active time" of the device.
//!        The trade-off here is that accelerometer data is a bit more susceptible to noise.
//!    - sleep time:
//!        The longer the sleep duration, the less power the device consums.
//!        After tsleep ms, a sample is taken, and then the device goes back to sleep.
//!
//! Power measurements on the board have shown we ideally want to run at a BW of 500Hz or 1000Hz.
//! Unfortunately, there is an issue with data jumps when running in low power modes.
//! At 4G sensitivity, we need to run at a bandwidth lower than 500Hz in order to minimize
//! jitter in readings. This means we probably want to stay at 250Hz.
//!
//! We are using Equidistant Sampling Mode (EST) to ensure that samples are taken
//! at equal time distances. See Figure 4 in the datasheet for an explanation of this.
//! In EST, a sample is taken every tsample ms, where tsample = (tsleep + wkup_time) [1]
//!
//! We can _approximate_ actual ODR as the following: [2]
//!        ODR = (1000 / (tsleep + wkup_time))
//!   where tsleep holds the property that:
//!        N = (2 * bw) * (tsleep / 1000) such that N is an Integer. [3][4]
//!   and wkup_time is taken for the corresponding bandwidth from Table 4 of the datasheet.
//!
//! [1] This is the best we can gather as a good approximation after a meeting with Bosch.
//! [2] This is only an approximation as the BMA255 part is only guaranteed to have
//!     Bandwidth accuracy within +/- 10%
//! [3] See p.16 of datasheet. Note that the formula in the datasheet is confirmed wrong by Bosch.
//! [4] Take note that all tsleep values are supported when running at 500Hz
