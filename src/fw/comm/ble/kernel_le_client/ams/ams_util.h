//! Parses a string with a real number into int32_t, using given multiplication factor.
//! @param number_str The string containing a real, base-10 number. Some valid examples: "-1.234",
//! "42", "-.1", "1,0", "-0".
//! The string does not have to be zero-terminated, since the length is passed as an argument.
//! @param number_str_length The length of the number_str buffer.
//! @param multiplier The factor by which to multiply the parsed number.
//! @param[out] number_out If the parsing was succesfull, the result will be stored here.
//! @return True if the string was parsed succesfully.
//! @note The first comma or period found is treated as decimal separator. Any subsequent comma or
//! period that is found will cause parsing to be aborted and return false.
//! @note An empty / zero-length string still will fail to parse and return false.
//! @note When the input number multiplied by the multiplier overflows the output storage (int32_t)
//! the function will return false.
