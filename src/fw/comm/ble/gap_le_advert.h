//! interval and duration. Each term is run in the order that they appear in the terms array.
//! The minimum advertisement interval for each term must be at minumum 32 slots (20ms), or
//! 160 slots (100ms) when there is a scan response. The maximum advertisement interval must
//! be larger than or equal to its corresponding min_interval_slots. The duration is the

//! argument with the unschedule callback.

//! @param tag A tag that will be used for debug logging.
//! @return Reference to the scheduled job, or NULL if the parameters were not
//! valid.
